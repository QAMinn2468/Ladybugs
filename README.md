## Credits

Slack @Rodrick[FEND] made an excellent video, which I used as a base.
In addition I was inspired by a fellow GwG FEND student's GREEN ladybugs (name unknown), and modified my ladybugs and Player
as a result using Paint 3D.
https://yoursammich.github.io/classic-arcade-game/ - is my favorite version to date, and inspired me to push and create the heart
to gain 1 life.
